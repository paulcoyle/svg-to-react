# svg-to-react

_NOTE: This project and README are very early; I will be refining soon._

`@paulcoyle/svg-to-react` is an "opinionated" (read: not very configurable and primarily built to serve my own needs) utility that will convert SVGs to React components.
There are other utilities that do this and likely do it much better but they lacked in some way (TODO: like, tell people what).
